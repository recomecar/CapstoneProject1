        <h3>Skills acquired along the way</h3>
        <p>I have traveled and lived in different countries, experiencing various cultures and languages, which has contributed to developing a broad perspective and adaptability, which can be valuable in a multicultural environment.

            My previous experience as a co-owner of a consulting firm in Brazil provided me with leadership, customer service, and specialized legal assistance, in addition to improving my communication and collaboration skills.
            
           My academic background in law and my membership in the Brazilian Bar Association reinforce my legal knowledge and ability to handle complex legal issues. Additionally, I possess analytical skills and a detailed work methodology, ensuring accuracy and efficiency in my work.</p>
